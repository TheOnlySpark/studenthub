                    <h4 class="ques">What is the minimum amount of attendance required by VISTAS for exam entry</h4>
                    <p class="ans">The minimum percentage of attendance required is 75%. In the cases of medical exemptions this percentage may drop around 65%.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="ques">How can I apply for Medical exemption if my attendance is lower than 75%</h4>
                    <p class="ans">Present a copy of a medical certificate given by the doctor to your class incharge faculty. Follow further instructions given by them. Usually you would be expected to write a letter and get signatures from both your class incharge and HOD. This letter should then be submitted to your class incharge with the medical certificate.</p>

                <li>
                    <h4 class="ques">How are the marks of exams calculated and consolidated at the end of each semester</h4>
                    <p class="ans">2 CAT exams (50 marks each which are calculated for 10 marks total) and 1 model session (calculated for 20 marks) account for 40% ; These are also reflected as internal marks. Semester end exams which are tested for 100 marks make up to 60% of the final CGPA. [(2 CATs + 1 Model)+(Sem end) = 40 + 60].</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="ques">What is the anti-ragging scheme?</h4>
